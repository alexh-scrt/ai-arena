# 🎯 AI ARENA - HIGH-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Overview

This plan provides a strategic roadmap for implementing AI Arena by leveraging proven components from **Homunculus** and **AI-Talks**, while building new competitive mechanics. Each phase includes specific references to source code that should be studied and adapted.

---

## 📋 Implementation Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Inherit, Don't Reinvent**: Reuse battle-tested code from both projects
2. **Incremental Integration**: Start small, validate, then scale
3. **Test-First Mentality**: Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Documentation as Code**: Keep docs synchronized with implementation
5. **Modular Architecture**: Enable independent component development

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with 2-3 characters before scaling to 15+
- Validate each phase before proceeding
- Maintain rollback points
- Keep legacy systems running during migration

---

## 🗺️ PHASE 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
**Duration**: Week 1-2  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Risk Level**: LOW

### Objectives
- Establish Arena as subproject within Homunculus
- Setup all required infrastructure services
- Define core data models and interfaces
- Create development environment

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Project structure created
- ✅ Docker infrastructure configured (Kafka, PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Environment configuration with validation
- ✅ Core data models defined with Pydantic
- ✅ Initial test framework established

### Next Steps
Begin Phase 2 with character integration

---

## 🎭 PHASE 2: Character Agent Integration
**Duration**: Week 3-4  
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Critical Phase**: This determines if the entire project is viable

### Objectives
- Adapt Homunculus multi-agent architecture for competitive context
- Create bridge between Homunculus characters and Arena orchestration
- Add Strategy Agent for competitive decision-making
- Validate character behavior in mock competitions

### 2.1 Study Homunculus Character System

**Reference Files to Study**:
```
homunculus/src/character_agent.py
├── CharacterAgent class (main orchestrator)
├── Agent consultation flow
├── Cognitive synthesis
└── State update mechanisms

homunculus/src/modules/agent_orchestrator.py
├── Multi-agent coordination
├── Priority-based consultation
├── Context building
└── Response generation

homunculus/src/agents/
├── personality_agent.py     # Big Five + traits
├── mood_agent.py            # Emotional state
├── neurochemical_agent.py   # 6 hormones
├── goals_agent.py           # Objectives
├── communication_style_agent.py
└── memory_agent.py          # Retrieval logic
```

- State management (how hormones decay, mood updates)
- Memory retrieval integration (ChromaDB queries)
- Cognitive synthesis approach (LLM-based integration)
- Personality consistency enforcement

### 2.2 Create Arena-Specific Adapter Layer

**New Components to Build**:

#### A. CharacterAdapter Protocol
```python
# src/arena/persona/character_adapter.py
# 
# Purpose: Bridge between Homunculus CharacterAgent and Arena needs
# 
# Key Methods:
# - generate_competition_response(context: CompetitionContext) -> Response
# - update_state_from_competition(event: CompetitionEvent)
# - retrieve_relevant_memories(query: str, k: int) -> List[Memory]
# - calculate_strategic_position(game_state: GameState) -> Strategy
```

**Inherit From Homunculus**:
- `homunculus/src/character_agent.py` - Main agent loop
- `homunculus/src/modules/agent_orchestrator.py` - Consultation pattern
- `homunculus/src/core/character_state.py` - State dataclass
- `homunculus/src/llm/ollama_client.py` - LLM interaction pattern (adapt for Anthropic)

**Modifications Needed**:
- Add competition context to agent inputs
- Bounded neurochemistry (prevent runaway hormones in high-stress)
- Strategic reasoning layer
- Turn-based response generation (vs continuous chat)

#### B. Strategy Agent (NEW)
```python
# src/arena/persona/strategy_agent.py
#
# Purpose: Competitive tactics and game theory analysis
# Does NOT exist in Homunculus - must build from scratch
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Analyze current competitive position
# - Recommend moves (from AI-Talks move types)
# - Evaluate threats from other characters
# - Coalition/alliance recommendations
# - Risk assessment
```

**Inherit From AI-Talks**:
- `talks/src/game_theory/payoff_calculator.py` - Move type concepts
- `talks/src/game_theory/turn_selector.py` - Strategic urgency calculation

**New Arena Concepts**:
- Survival pressure modeling
- Elimination risk assessment
- Champion advantage analysis
- Accusation strategy

### 2.3 Memory System Integration

**Reference Files from Homunculus**:
```
homunculus/src/memory/experience_module.py
├── ChromaDB collection management
├── Semantic search implementation
├── Experience storage format
└── Metadata tagging

homunculus/src/memory/knowledge_graph.py
├── Neo4j entity storage
├── Relationship management
└── Query patterns
```

**Modifications for Arena**:
- Add competition-specific metadata to memories
- Store relationship dynamics with other competitors
- Track strategic lessons learned
- Champion memory preservation across rounds

**New Memory Types**:
```python
CompetitionMemory:
    - competition_id
    - opponent_characters
    - strategies_used
    - elimination_context
    - outcome
    - lessons_learned

StrategicMemory:
    - successful_tactics
    - failed_approaches
    - opponent_patterns
    - judge_preferences
```

### 2.4 Bounded Neurochemistry

**Challenge**: Competition stress could cause hormone runaway

**Solution**: Implement bounds and dampening

**Reference from Homunculus**:
```
homunculus/src/agents/neurochemical_agent.py
├── calculate_hormone_changes()
├── decay_toward_baseline()
└── apply_stimulus()
```

**Arena Modifications**:
```python
# Add competitive bounds
COMPETITION_HORMONE_CAPS = {
    'cortisol': 0.85,    # Prevent panic (was 1.0)
    'adrenaline': 0.80,  # Prevent reckless (was 1.0)
    'dopamine': 0.90,    # Prevent overconfidence
}

# Add dampening for extreme situations
def apply_competitive_dampening(
    hormones: Dict[str, float],
    stress_level: float
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Prevent hormone extremes during high-stress competition"""
```

### 2.5 Integration Testing

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Single Character Response**
   - Load 1 character (Ada Lovelace)
   - Provide competition context
   - Generate response
   - Verify personality consistency
   - Check hormone levels remain bounded

2. **2-Character Mock Debate**
   - Load 2 characters (Ada + Grimbold)
   - Simulate 5-turn exchange
   - Verify distinct personalities
   - Check relationship dynamics
   - Validate memory creation

3. **Stress Test**
   - Load 4 characters
   - Simulate elimination pressure
   - Verify hormones don't runaway
   - Check strategic reasoning works

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Characters maintain personality consistency (>90%)
- ✅ Response time <10s per turn
- ✅ Neurochemistry stays bounded
- ✅ Strategic reasoning is coherent
- ✅ Memory retrieval is relevant

**Deliverables**:
- CharacterAdapter implementation
- Strategy Agent implementation
- Bounded neurochemistry system
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation of modifications

## 🎼 PHASE 3: Orchestration Engine
**Duration**: Week 5-6  
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

### Objectives
- Implement LangGraph state machine for competition flow
- Port AI-Talks orchestration patterns
- Create turn management system
- Build narrator and progression analysis
- Enable phase transitions

### 3.1 Study AI-Talks Orchestration

**Reference Files to Study**:
```
talks/src/orchestration/orchestrator.py
├── MultiAgentDiscussionOrchestrator (CORE)
├── run_discussion() - main loop
├── State management patterns
└── Narrator integration

talks/src/states/group_state.py
├── GroupDiscussionState dataclass
├── State tracking approach
└── Participant state management

talks/src/states/participant_state.py
├── ParticipantState dataclass
├── Personality archetypes
└── Gender representation
```

**Key Patterns to Extract**:
- Centralized orchestration pattern
- State-driven architecture
- Turn-by-turn progression
- Context accumulation
- Narrator interjection logic
- Termination detection

### 3.2 Build Arena Competition Coordinator

**New Component**:
```python
# src/arena/flow/competition_coordinator.py
#
# Purpose: Main orchestration of Arena competitions
# Based on AI-Talks orchestrator but adapted for competition
#
# Key Differences from AI-Talks:
# - Elimination mechanics
# - Scoring after each turn
# - Champion persistence
# - Accusation handling
# - Multi-round support
```

**Inherit from AI-Talks**:
- State machine pattern
- Turn management logic
- Context building
- Phase transitions
- Narrator coordination

**Reference Implementation**:
```
talks/src/orchestration/orchestrator.py
Lines 150-350: run_discussion() method
├── Turn selection
├── Agent prompting
├── Context management
└── State updates
```

**Arena Extensions**:
- Judge scoring after each contribution
- Elimination threshold checking
- Champion state preservation
- Accusation interruption flow

### 3.3 Implement Turn Selection (Game Theory)

**Reference Files from AI-Talks**:
```
talks/src/game_theory/turn_selector.py
├── TurnSelector class
├── select_next_speaker() (CRITICAL)
├── calculate_speaking_urgency()
└── Fairness mechanisms

talks/src/game_theory/payoff_calculator.py
├── PayoffCalculator class
├── calculate_move_payoffs()
├── recommend_move_and_target()
└── Move types: DEEPEN, CHALLENGE, SUPPORT, etc.
```

**Key Concepts**:
- **Urgency Calculation**: Multi-factor weighted formula
  ```python
  urgency = (
      personality_baseline * 0.30 +
      time_since_spoke * 0.20 +
      was_addressed * 0.40 +
      confidence * 0.10 +
      engagement * 0.20
  )
  ```
- **Fairness**: Prevent single character domination
- **Strategic Randomness**: 80% game theory + 20% chaos
- **Move Recommendations**: What type of contribution to make

**Arena Modifications**:
```python
# src/arena/flow/turn_selector.py
#
# Inherit from AI-Talks but add:
# - Survival pressure factor (characters near elimination speak more)
# - Champion advantage (previous winner gets slight priority)
# - Accusation urgency (accusers/defenders get priority)
# - Elimination immunity (just-eliminated can't be selected)
```

**Additional Arena Factors**:
```python
arena_urgency_modifiers = {
    'elimination_risk': 0.15,     # High risk = higher urgency
    'champion_bonus': 0.05,       # Champion gets slight edge
    'accusation_active': 0.30,    # Involved parties prioritized
    'recent_elimination': -1.0,   # Just eliminated = 0 urgency
}
```

### 3.4 Build Narrator Agent

**Reference from AI-Talks**:
```
talks/src/agents/narrator_agent.py
├── NarratorAgent class
├── generate_introduction() - Multi-phase intro
├── generate_interjection() - Dynamic commentary
├── generate_closing() - Synthesis
└── Prompt templates
```

**Key Features to Inherit**:
- Multi-phase introduction (welcome → topic → participants → transition)
- Contextual interjections (every N turns)
- Dramatic arc awareness
- Closing synthesis

**Arena Extensions**:
```python
# src/arena/agents/narrator_agent.py
#
# Inherit from AI-Talks NarratorAgent and add:
# - Elimination announcements
# - Score updates
# - Tension building
# - Champion introductions
# - Round transitions
```

**New Narrator Responsibilities**:
- Announce competition start with stakes
- Periodic score updates (not constant)
- Build tension before eliminations
- Announce eliminations with drama
- Facilitate final words from eliminated
- Multi-round transitions
- Champion coronation

### 3.5 Progression Analysis

**Reference from AI-Talks**:
```
talks/src/controllers/progression_controller.py
├── ProgressionController class
├── analyze_progression() - Detect orbiting
├── _detect_orbiting() - Semantic similarity
└── _calculate_orbiting_score()
```

**Key Concepts**:
- **Orbiting Detection**: Conversation going in circles
- **Semantic Similarity**: Vector comparison over time
- **Quality Signals**: Depth vs breadth
- **Intervention Logic**: When to force pivot

**Arena Adaptations**:
```python
# src/arena/flow/progression_analyzer.py
#
# Inherit from AI-Talks but modify:
# - Orbiting = signal for elimination candidate (not just quality issue)
# - Track per-character contribution quality over time
# - Detect manipulation patterns
# - Flag paraphrasing early
```

**Arena-Specific Metrics**:
```python
ProgressionMetrics:
    - per_character_novelty_trend
    - paraphrasing_incidents
    - collaboration_patterns
    - manipulation_attempts
    - strategic_diversity
```

### 3.6 Phase Management

**Competition Phases**:
```python
# src/arena/models/competition_phase.py

class CompetitionPhase(Enum):
    OPENING_STATEMENTS = "opening"
    CROSS_EXAMINATION = "cross_exam"
    FREE_DISCUSSION = "discussion"
    ACCUSATION_PERIOD = "accusation"
    ELIMINATION = "elimination"
    FINAL_WORDS = "final_words"
    REBUTTALS = "rebuttals"
    CLOSING_STATEMENTS = "closing"
    SYNTHESIS = "synthesis"
```

**Phase Transition Logic**:
```python
# Reference AI-Talks state transitions
# talks/src/orchestration/orchestrator.py (lines 200-250)
#
# But add Arena-specific:
# - Time limits per phase
# - Turn count limits
# - Quality thresholds
# - Elimination triggers
# - Accusation interruptions
```

### 3.7 Integration with LangGraph

**Pattern to Implement**:
```python
# src/arena/flow/competition_graph.py
#
# Use LangGraph StateGraph for state machine
# Similar to AI-Talks usage but with Arena phases
#
# States:
# - initialize
# - opening_statements
# - discussion_turn
# - judge_scoring
# - check_elimination
# - elimination_procedure
# - closing
# - generate_content
#
# Edges:
# - Conditional transitions based on phase/scores/time
# - Loop back to discussion_turn until termination
# - Branch to elimination when threshold hit
```

**Reference AI-Talks Pattern**:
- AI-Talks uses LangGraph for state management
- Follow similar state transition patterns
- Adapt for competitive flow

### 3.8 Testing Strategy

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Phase Transitions**
   - Verify all phases execute in order
   - Test early termination
   - Test accusation interruption
   - Validate time limits

   - Test manipulation detection
   - Validate quality metrics

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Complete competition flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Turn selection is fair (no single character >40% of turns)
- ✅ Narrator enhances without disrupting
- ✅ Phase transitions are smooth
- ✅ Orbiting is detected within 3 cycles
- ✅ Response time <15s per turn (including all agents)

**Deliverables**:

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Critical for**: Fair competition and anti-gaming

### Objectives
- Implement multi-judge ensemble
- Create rubric-based scoring engine
- Build anti-gaming detection systems
- Develop elimination mechanics
- Add accusation flow

### 4.1 Study AI-Talks Scoring Patterns

**Reference Files**:
```
talks/src/game_theory/strategic_coordinator.py
├── StrategicCoordinator class
├── evaluate_strategic_alignment()
├── detect_originality()
└── Scoring rubrics

talks/src/utils/redundancy_checker.py
├── RedundancyChecker class
├── check_redundancy()
└── Semantic similarity detection
```

**Key Concepts to Extract**:
- Multi-dimensional evaluation
- Semantic similarity for redundancy
- Originality scoring
- Strategic alignment metrics
- Quality thresholds

### 4.2 Build Judge Agent

**New Component**:
```python
# src/arena/agents/judge_agent.py
#
# Purpose: Evaluate contributions across multiple dimensions
# Does NOT exist in AI-Talks - must build for Arena
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Score each contribution (0-10 per dimension)
# - Provide reasoning for scores
# - Maintain consistency across competition
# - Detect gaming attempts
# - Make elimination decisions
```

**Scoring Dimensions** (from design docs):
```python
SCORING_RUBRIC = {
    'novelty': {
        'weight': 0.25,
        'description': 'Originality of ideas',
        'criteria': [...]
    },
    'builds_on_others': {
        'weight': 0.20,
        'description': 'Collaborative synthesis',
        'criteria': [...]
    },
    'solves_subproblem': {
        'weight': 0.25,
        'description': 'Problem-solving contribution',
        'criteria': [...]
    },
    'radical_idea': {
        'weight': 0.15,
        'description': 'Paradigm-shifting thinking',
        'criteria': [...]
    },
    'manipulation': {
        'weight': 0.15,
        'description': 'Strategic influence (positive or negative)',
        'criteria': [...]
    }
}
```

**Judge Prompting Strategy**:
- Clear rubric in system prompt
- Examples of each score level (0-10)
- Require reasoning before scoring
- Consistency emphasis
- Independence from other judges

### 4.3 Judge Ensemble System

**Architecture**:
```python
# src/arena/judging/judge_ensemble.py
#
# Purpose: Coordinate multiple judges for bias reduction
#
# Pattern:
# 1. Distribute contribution to N judges (N=3 recommended)
# 2. Collect independent scores
# 3. Detect outliers
# 4. Aggregate (median or weighted average)
# 5. Combine reasoning
```

**Aggregation Strategies**:
```python
def aggregate_scores(
    judge_scores: List[Dict[str, float]],
    method: str = 'median'
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Methods:
    - median: Robust to outliers
    - mean: Simple average
    - trimmed_mean: Remove top/bottom, then average
    - weighted: Weight by judge confidence
    """
```

**Inter-Judge Agreement**:
```python
def calculate_agreement(
    judge_scores: List[Dict[str, float]]
) -> float:
    """
    Use Krippendorff's alpha or similar
    Target: >0.70 agreement
    """
```

### 4.4 Anti-Gaming Systems

**Build New Components**:

#### A. Paraphrasing Detector
```python
# src/arena/judging/anti_gaming/paraphrasing_detector.py
#
# Purpose: Detect when characters restate others' ideas
#
# Approach:
# 1. Embed all contributions (sentence-transformers)
# 2. Compare new contribution to all previous
# 3. High similarity (>0.85) = paraphrasing
# 4. Flag and apply penalty
```

**Reference from AI-Talks**:
```
talks/src/utils/redundancy_checker.py
├── Semantic similarity approach
├── Threshold-based detection
└── Vector comparison logic
```

**Arena Extensions**:
- Track per-character history
- Identify original source
- Severity levels (mild vs blatant)
- Penalty calculation

#### B. Repetition Checker
```python
# src/arena/judging/anti_gaming/repetition_checker.py
#
# Purpose: Detect when characters repeat their own ideas
#
# Approach:
# 1. Compare to character's own history
# 2. Detect self-similarity (>0.75)
# 3. Flag and apply penalty
# 4. Track repetition patterns
```

#### C. Manipulation Analyzer
```python
# src/arena/judging/anti_gaming/manipulation_analyzer.py
#
# Purpose: Distinguish persuasion from deception
#
# Dimensions to Evaluate:
# - Factual accuracy
# - Logical consistency
# - Emotional appeals (appropriate vs manipulative)
# - Ad hominem attacks
# - Strawman arguments
# - Appeal to authority (legitimate vs false)
```

**LLM-Based Analysis**:
- Provide manipulation taxonomy in prompt
- Request detailed classification
- Score positive persuasion separately from deception
- Provide specific examples detected

#### D. Corpus Comparison
```python
# src/arena/judging/anti_gaming/corpus_comparator.py
#
# Purpose: Compare to entire competition history
#
# Approach:
# 1. Maintain FAISS index of all contributions
# 2. Query new contribution against index
# 3. Find top-K similar (K=5)
# 4. Threshold checks (>0.70 = concern)
# 5. Context-aware penalties
```

### 4.5 Rubric Engine

**Component**:
```python
# src/arena/judging/rubric_engine.py
#
# Purpose: Codify scoring criteria and apply consistently
#
# Features:
# - Load rubric from YAML config
# - Validate score against criteria
# - Generate scoring prompts for judges
# - Provide examples for each level
# - Track rubric application consistency
```

**Rubric Structure** (YAML):
```yaml
novelty:
  weight: 0.25
  levels:
    10: "Completely original paradigm-shifting idea..."
    8-9: "Novel approach building on existing..."
    6-7: "Moderate originality with some new angles..."
    4-5: "Slight variations on known ideas..."
    2-3: "Mostly familiar concepts..."
    0-1: "Pure repetition or paraphrasing..."
  examples:
    - score: 10
      contribution: "..."
      reasoning: "..."
```

### 4.6 Elimination Mechanics

**Flow**:
```python
# src/arena/judging/elimination_flow.py
#
# Purpose: Handle elimination process
#
# Steps:
# 1. Identify candidate (lowest cumulative score)
# 2. Check if below threshold (e.g., -10.0)
# 3. Judge announces elimination with full reasoning
# 4. Narrator builds tension
# 5. Give eliminated character final words (60s)
# 6. Update competition state
# 7. Learning signal for survivors (what went wrong)
# 8. Remove from active pool
```

**Considerations**:
- Minimum turns before elimination (prevent early randomness)
- Tie-breaking rules (if multiple below threshold)
- Champion immunity (optional, 1 round grace)
- Accusation overrides (accused proven guilty)

### 4.7 Accusation System

**New Component**:
```python
# src/arena/flow/accusation_handler.py
#
# Purpose: Handle cheating accusations between characters
#
# Flow:
# 1. Character makes accusation (special move type)
# 2. Pause main discussion
# 3. Accused gets defense (60s)
# 4. Judge evaluates evidence
# 5. "Beyond reasonable doubt" standard
# 6. Verdict:
#    - Guilty: Immediate elimination
#    - Not Guilty: Accuser penalty (-5 points)
#    - Insufficient: No penalty, warning issued
# 7. Resume main discussion
```

**Evidence Types**:
- Semantic similarity data
- Pattern detection results
- Specific contribution references
- Character relationship context

**Judge Evaluation**:
- High bar for guilt (protect against false accusations)
- Detailed reasoning required
- Consider motivation of accuser
- Review full context

### 4.8 Testing Strategy

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Single Judge Scoring**
   - Known good contribution → high scores
   - Known paraphrasing → low novelty score
   - Known repetition → penalty applied
   - Verify reasoning quality

2. **Judge Ensemble**
   - 3 judges score same contribution
   - Check inter-judge agreement (>0.70)
   - Verify outlier detection
   - Test aggregation methods

3. **Anti-Gaming Detection**
   - Blatant paraphrase → detected and flagged
   - Self-repetition → detected and flagged
   - Manipulation → classified correctly
   - False positives minimized

4. **Elimination Flow**
   - Character below threshold → eliminated
   - Elimination announcement → complete
   - Final words → recorded
   - State updated correctly

5. **Accusation System**
   - Valid accusation → investigation triggered
   - Guilty verdict → immediate elimination
   - False accusation → accuser penalized
   - Edge cases handled

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Judge ensemble agreement >70%
- ✅ Paraphrasing detection accuracy >90%
- ✅ Repetition detection accuracy >85%
- ✅ Manipulation classification precision >80%
- ✅ Eliminations are justified and consistent
- ✅ Accusation system prevents abuse

**Deliverables**:
- Judge Agent implementation
- Judge Ensemble system
- Complete anti-gaming suite
- Rubric Engine
- Elimination mechanics
- Accusation handler
- Comprehensive test suite
- Documentation of scoring methodology

#
# Purpose: Save and restore champion state
#
# What to Persist:
# - Complete CharacterState (from Homunculus)
# - Competition memories (ChromaDB references)
# - Strategic lessons learned
# - Relationship dynamics
# - Performance metrics
# - Personality evolution (if any)
```

**Storage Strategy**:
```python
def save_champion_state(
    character_id: str,
    state: CharacterState,
    competition_id: str
) -> str:
    """
    1. Serialize CharacterState to JSON
    2. Store in PostgreSQL champions table
    3. Mark relevant memories in ChromaDB
    4. Update Neo4j knowledge graph
    5. Return champion_state_id
    """

def load_champion_state(
    champion_state_id: str
) -> CharacterState:
    """
    1. Retrieve from PostgreSQL
    2. Deserialize JSON
    3. Restore ChromaDB memory access
    4. Restore Neo4j connections
    5. Return fully hydrated CharacterState
    """
```

**Considerations**:
- Version compatibility (if CharacterState schema changes)
- Memory pruning (don't carry infinite memories)
- Selective advantage (champion has edge but not overwhelming)

        self.postgres = PostgresClient(...)
        self.redis = RedisClient(...)
        self.faiss = FAISSIndex(...)
    
    def store_competition_memory(
        self,
        character_id: str,
        memory: CompetitionMemory
    ):
        """Store across appropriate systems"""
        # ChromaDB for semantic search
        # Neo4j for relationships
        # PostgreSQL for history
        # Redis for active cache
    
    def retrieve_relevant_context(
        self,
        character_id: str,
        query: str,
        k: int = 5
    ) -> List[Memory]:
        """Unified retrieval across systems"""
```

## 🏆 PHASE 7: Competition Types
**Duration**: Week 11  
**Risk Level**: LOW  
**Dependencies**: Phases 3, 4, 6 complete

### Objectives
- Implement multiple competition types beyond debate
- Create type-specific configurations
- Build competition type registry
- Develop specialized scoring rubrics

### 7.1 Competition Type Architecture

**Registry Pattern**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/competition_registry.py
#
# Purpose: Register and manage competition types
#
# Pattern:
# 1. Each type is a subclass of BaseCompetition
# 2. Registry maintains type → class mapping
# 3. Factory method creates instances
# 4. Type-specific configuration validation
```

**Base Class**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/base_competition.py
#
# Purpose: Abstract base for all competition types
#
# Must Implement:
# - get_phases() -> List[CompetitionPhase]
# - get_scoring_rubric() -> ScoringRubric
# - validate_config(config: Dict) -> bool
# - customize_narrator_prompts() -> Dict[str, str]
# - customize_judge_prompts() -> Dict[str, str]
```

### 7.2 Competition Type 1: Debate (Already Designed)

**Reference**: Design documents have complete debate specification

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/debate_competition.py
#
# Phases:
# 1. Opening statements
# 2. Cross-examination
# 3. Free discussion
# 4. Elimination
# 5. Rebuttals
# 6. Closing statements
# 7. Synthesis
```

**Scoring Emphasis**:
- Logical argumentation: HIGH
- Evidence quality: HIGH
- Refutation skill: HIGH
- Novelty: MEDIUM

### 7.3 Competition Type 2: Story Battle

**Concept**: Characters collaboratively build a story, competing on creativity

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/story_battle_competition.py
#
# Phases:
# 1. Setting establishment (each character proposes)
# 2. Character introduction (each introduces protagonist)
# 3. Collaborative story building (20 turns)
#    - Each turn adds plot element
#    - Must build on previous contributions
# 4. Elimination (lowest creativity score)
# 5. Plot twist phase (survivors add twists)
# 6. Resolution phase (collaborative ending)
# 7. Story synthesis
```

**Scoring Rubric**:
```python
story_battle_rubric = {
    'creativity': 0.30,        # Originality of ideas
    'narrative_coherence': 0.25, # Story consistency
    'character_depth': 0.20,   # Character development
    'builds_on_others': 0.15,  # Collaborative synthesis
    'emotional_impact': 0.10   # Engagement factor
}
```

**Special Rules**:
- Must reference previous story elements
- No contradicting established facts
- Encourage plot twists (bonus points)
- Genre consistency maintained

### 7.4 Competition Type 3: Philosophy Roundtable

**Concept**: Deep philosophical exploration without elimination pressure (until end)

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/philosophy_roundtable.py
#
# Phases:
# 1. Position statements (philosophical stance)
# 2. Dialectic exploration (15 turns)
#    - Socratic questioning
#    - Conceptual analysis
#    - Thought experiments
# 3. Integration phase (find common ground)
# 4. Single elimination (weakest philosophical rigor)
# 5. Deeper dive (survivors go meta)
# 6. Synthesis by remaining characters
```

**Scoring Rubric**:
```python
philosophy_rubric = {
    'conceptual_clarity': 0.25,  # Clear definitions
    'logical_rigor': 0.25,       # Valid reasoning
    'philosophical_depth': 0.20, # Goes beyond surface
    'integration_skill': 0.15,   # Synthesizes views
    'thought_experiments': 0.15  # Creative scenarios
}
```

**Reference AI-Talks Patterns**:
- High depth level (4-5)
- Quote enrichment enabled
- Progression analysis for depth tracking

### 7.5 Competition Type 4: Creative Challenge

**Concept**: Characters solve creative problems under constraints

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/creative_challenge.py
#
# Phases:
# 1. Challenge reveal (problem statement)
# 2. Brainstorming (rapid ideation, 10 turns)
# 3. Refinement (develop top ideas)
# 4. Elimination (least viable solution)
# 5. Prototype phase (detail solutions)
# 6. Final presentations
# 7. Winner selection
```

**Example Challenges**:
- Design a city for 2100
- Create a new musical instrument
- Invent a sport for zero gravity
- Design ethical AI regulation
- Create a universal language

**Scoring Rubric**:
```python
creative_challenge_rubric = {
    'innovation': 0.30,         # Novel approach
    'feasibility': 0.20,        # Could actually work
    'constraint_adherence': 0.15, # Follows rules
    'impact_potential': 0.20,   # How transformative
    'presentation': 0.15        # How well explained
}
```

### 7.6 Competition Type 5: QuickFire

**Concept**: Rapid-fire competition, short turns, fast eliminations

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/competitions/quickfire_competition.py
#
# Phases:
# 1. Rapid introductions (30s each)
# 2. QuickFire rounds (5 turns per round)
#    - Each character gets 60s max
#    - After each round: eliminate one
# 3. Repeat until 2 remain
# 4. Final showdown (3 turns each)
# 5. Winner declared
```

**Scoring Rubric**:
```python
quickfire_rubric = {
    'speed_of_insight': 0.30,   # Quick thinking
    'clarity': 0.25,            # Concise expression
    'wit': 0.20,                # Clever responses
    'relevance': 0.15,          # Stays on topic
    'engagement': 0.10          # Entertaining
}
```

**Special Rules**:
- 100-word limit per turn (strict)
- 60-second time limit
- No quote enrichment (too slow)
- Immediate elimination after each round

### 7.7 Configuration Templates

      character_depth: 0.20
      builds_on_others: 0.15
      emotional_impact: 0.10
```

### 7.8 Type-Specific Narrator Prompts

**Customization**:
```python
# Each competition type customizes narrator behavior

debate_narrator_style = {
    'tone': 'formal',
    'focus': 'argumentation quality',
    'metaphors': 'courtroom, chess, battle',
    'interjections': 'highlight logical moves'

- Create matchmaking algorithms
- Develop scheduling system
- Enable tournament state management

### 8.1 Tournament Architecture

**Component Structure**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/
├── tournament_manager.py      # Main coordinator
├── bracket_generator.py       # Bracket creation
├── matchmaking.py             # Character pairing
├── elo_system.py              # Rating calculations
├── scheduler.py               # Competition scheduling
└── tournament_state.py        # State management
```

### 8.2 Bracket Generation

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/bracket_generator.py
#
# Purpose: Generate tournament brackets
#
# Bracket Types:
# - Single elimination
# - Double elimination
# - Round robin
# - Swiss system
# - Custom (mixed)
```

**Bracket Structures**:
```python
class BracketType(Enum):
    SINGLE_ELIM = "single_elimination"
    DOUBLE_ELIM = "double_elimination"
    ROUND_ROBIN = "round_robin"
    SWISS = "swiss"
    GAUNTLET = "gauntlet"  # One champion vs challengers

@dataclass
class Bracket:
    bracket_id: str
    bracket_type: BracketType
    rounds: List[Round]
    participants: List[str]  # character_ids
    seeding: Dict[str, int]  # character_id -> seed
    current_round: int
```

**Seeding Strategies**:
- Random seeding
- ELO-based seeding (higher rated avoid each other early)
- Manual seeding
- Balanced seeding (mix ratings)

### 8.3 ELO Rating System

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/elo_system.py
#
# Purpose: Track character skill ratings
#
# Based on: Standard ELO system with K-factor tuning
```

**ELO Formula**:
```python
def calculate_elo_change(
    player_rating: float,
    opponent_rating: float,
    result: float,  # 1.0 = win, 0.5 = draw, 0.0 = loss
    k_factor: float = 32
) -> float:
    """
    Expected score: E = 1 / (1 + 10^((opponent - player)/400))
    New rating: R' = R + K * (result - E)
    """
    expected = 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((opponent_rating - player_rating) / 400))
    return k_factor * (result - expected)
```

**Character Rating System**:
```python
@dataclass
class CharacterRating:
    character_id: str
    current_rating: float  # Start at 1500
    peak_rating: float
    games_played: int
    wins: int
    losses: int
    win_rate: float
    rating_history: List[Tuple[datetime, float]]
    
    # Competition type specific
    rating_by_type: Dict[str, float]  # debate: 1600, story: 1450, etc.
```

**Rating Updates**:
- After each competition
- Type-specific ratings maintained
- Overall rating = weighted average
- Provisional ratings for new characters (<20 games)

### 8.4 Matchmaking System

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/matchmaking.py
#
# Purpose: Intelligent character pairing
#
# Considerations:
# - ELO balance (fair matches)
# - Character diversity (personality variety)
# - Previous matchups (avoid repetition)
# - Storyline potential (interesting dynamics)
```

**Matchmaking Algorithms**:

#### A. ELO-Balanced Matching
```python
def elo_balanced_matching(
    available_characters: List[str],
    ratings: Dict[str, float],
    target_count: int = 4
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Select characters with similar ratings
    Difference < 200 ELO points preferred
    """
```

#### B. Personality-Diverse Matching
```python
def personality_diverse_matching(
    available_characters: List[str],
    personalities: Dict[str, Dict],
    target_count: int = 4
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Maximize personality diversity
    Use Big Five traits as vectors
    Maximize variance
    """
```

#### C. Storyline Matching
```python
def storyline_matching(
    available_characters: List[str],
    relationships: Dict[Tuple[str, str], float],
    history: List[Competition],
    target_count: int = 4
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Create interesting dynamics
    - Rivals paired (negative relationship)
    - Allies mixed (positive relationship)
    - Novel pairings preferred
    """
```

#### D. Hybrid Matching
```python
def hybrid_matching(
    characters: List[str],
    weights: Dict[str, float] = {
        'elo_balance': 0.40,
        'personality_diversity': 0.30,
        'storyline_potential': 0.20,
        'novelty': 0.10
    }
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Combine multiple criteria
    """
```

### 8.5 Scheduling System

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/scheduler.py
#
# Purpose: Schedule competitions in tournament
#
# Considerations:
# - Parallel execution (multiple competitions simultaneously)
# - Character availability (no double-booking)
# - Resource limits (LLM rate limits)
# - Time windows (complete before deadline)
# - Dependencies (winner needed for next round)
```

**Scheduling Algorithm**:
```python
@dataclass
class ScheduledCompetition:
    competition_id: str
    participants: List[str]
    competition_type: str
    scheduled_start: datetime
    estimated_duration: timedelta
    dependencies: List[str]  # competition_ids that must complete first
    status: str  # scheduled, running, completed, failed

def generate_schedule(
    bracket: Bracket,
    parallelism: int = 4,  # Max concurrent competitions
    start_time: datetime = None
) -> List[ScheduledCompetition]:
    """
    Generate optimized schedule
    Maximize parallelism while respecting dependencies
    """
```

**Resource Management**:
```python
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(
        self,
        max_concurrent_competitions: int = 4,
        llm_rate_limit: int = 100  # requests per minute
    ):
        self.character_availability = {}  # character_id -> available_at
        self.active_competitions = []
        self.llm_budget = llm_rate_limit
    
    def can_start_competition(
        self,
        competition: ScheduledCompetition
    ) -> bool:
        """Check if resources available"""
```

### 8.6 Tournament State Management

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/tournament_state.py
#
# Purpose: Track tournament progress
```

**State Schema**:
```python
@dataclass
class TournamentState:
    tournament_id: str
    name: str
    bracket_type: BracketType
    
    # Participants
    original_participants: List[str]
    remaining_participants: List[str]
    eliminated_participants: List[str]
    
    # Progress
    current_round: int
    total_rounds: int
    completed_competitions: List[str]
    scheduled_competitions: List[ScheduledCompetition]
    
    # Results
    competition_results: Dict[str, CompetitionResult]
    round_winners: Dict[int, List[str]]
    
    # Champion
    champion_id: Optional[str]
    runner_up_id: Optional[str]
    
    # Metadata
    started_at: datetime
    completed_at: Optional[datetime]
    status: str  # active, paused, completed, cancelled
```

**State Persistence**:
- Save state after each competition
- Enable pause/resume
- Rollback on error
- Historical state tracking

### 8.7 Tournament Types

**Implementations**:

#### A. Championship Tournament
```python
# Standard tournament to crown champion
# - Single elimination
# - ELO seeding
# - 8-16 participants
# - Winner takes trophy
```

#### B. League Season
```python
# Round robin over extended period
# - Every character faces every other
# - Accumulate points
# - Top 4 advance to playoffs
# - Season champion crowned
```

#### C. Gauntlet Challenge
```python
# Reigning champion vs challengers
# - Champion in every competition
# - Challengers rotate
# - Champion retains until defeated
# - "Longest reign" tracking
```

#### D. Themed Tournament
```python
# Competition type specific
# - All debates OR all story battles
# - Topic-focused (all ethics debates)
# - Specialty characters excel
```

### 8.8 Leaderboards & Rankings

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/arena/tournament/leaderboards.py
#
# Purpose: Generate rankings and leaderboards
```

**Leaderboard Types**:
```python
# Overall ELO Rankings
def get_overall_rankings() -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    """Character rankings by ELO"""

# Competition Type Rankings
def get_type_rankings(competition_type: str) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    """Rankings per competition type"""

# Win Rate Rankings
def get_winrate_rankings(min_games: int = 10) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    """Rankings by win percentage"""

# Recent Form
def get_hot_streak_rankings(window: int = 10) -> List[str]:
    """Characters on winning streaks"""

# Head-to-Head Records
def get_head_to_head(char1: str, char2: str) -> H2HRecord:

## 🎯 Key Success Factors

### 1. Leverage Existing Assets
- **From Homunculus**: Character system, memory infrastructure, neurochemical simulation
- **From AI-Talks**: Orchestration patterns, game theory, content generation, progression analysis
- **Key**: Adapt, don't rewrite

### 2. Incremental Validation
- Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain rollback points
- Validate with small-scale before scaling

### 3. Quality Over Speed
- Each component must meet quality bar
- Don't skip testing
- Technical debt avoided through proper design

### 4. Documentation as Code
- Keep docs synchronized with implementation
- Document decisions and rationale
- Make onboarding easy

### 5. Community Feedback
- Beta test early and often
- Listen to user needs
- Iterate based on feedback

## 🚨 Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Character Integration** (Phase 2)
   - Mitigation: Start with 2-3 characters, validate thoroughly
   
2. **Judging Fairness** (Phase 4)
   - Mitigation: Judge ensemble, extensive testing, human validation

3. **Performance** (Throughout)
   - Mitigation: Continuous profiling, optimization sprints

### Contingency Plans
- **Character Issues**: Fall back to simpler personality models temporarily
- **Performance Issues**: Increase caching, reduce LLM calls
- **Quality Issues**: Add more validation layers, stricter rubrics

## ✅ Next Steps

**Immediate Actions** (Week 3):
1. Begin Phase 2: Character Integration
2. Study Homunculus character system in detail
3. Design CharacterAdapter interface
4. Create Strategy Agent specification
5. Plan bounded neurochemistry system

**This Week's Goals**:
- Complete CharacterAdapter implementation
- Integrate 2 test characters (Ada + Grimbold)
- Validate character responses in mock competition
- Pass all Phase 2 integration tests
